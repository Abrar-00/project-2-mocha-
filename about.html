        <h1>Our Vision Mission and Values</h1>
        <h3>
          Ensuring product quality is choosing not to take the easy way. It’s
          not the fast way. It’s the right way, and it creates the best coffee
          possible. We understand coffee is more than a pick me up. If we want
          to make someone’s day, we’ve got to give a little bit of ourselves in
          every cup we serve. Every MOcHA Coffees crew member is a keeper of
          that single cherry, from the time it gets picked up until the time
          it’s brewed, but what makes normal beautiful is the goodness that sits
          on top of a cup of coffee.
        </h3>
        <h1>Sustainablity</h1>
        <h3>
          We take our coffee very seriously at MOcHA, so not only does it taste
          great, but we also make sure we buy from suppliers that look after
          both their workers and the environment. Our coffee beans are sourced
          from all over the world and from many different farms of all types and
          sizes – large plantations, co-operative groups and tiny family farms.
          This means that there is no one size fits all approach to buying
          responsibly, but we are focused on promoting sustainable farming and a
          better outcome for all.
